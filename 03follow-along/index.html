        <h1>Types of Utah Fish</h1> 
        <p>In nearly every corner of the state, Utah’s rivers, lakes, and streams have <strong>excellent fishing</strong> that any angler would appreciate. From high alpine lakes to unassuming desert waters, a variety of species can be caught and admired year-round. In fact, Utah is home to 40 Blue Ribbon fisheries. The term “Blue Ribbon” refers to waters with healthy fish habitats that provide superb outdoor experiences and exceptional fishing.</p>    
        <p>There are many different species of fish in Utah. The main categories are trout, bass, panfish, catfish, etc.</p>
            
        <h2>Trout Diet</h2>  
            <ul>
                <li>In streams, young feed mainly on aquatic and terrestrial drift invertebrates; in lakes, they feed on zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. Large adults feed on fishes, crayfish, and other benthic invertebrates.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Best Trout Lures</h2>    
            <p>Spinners, spoons and flies can be just as successful and will give you the feeling of the hit when a fish strikes. Most spinners and spoons are heavy enough to cast just as they are. Consider using a swivel 3 to 4 inches above the lure to help avoid line twist.</p>
